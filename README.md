# vaccine_code_samples

Two simple scripts I wrote to pull vaccination figures as part of a code test. These scripts were run from within an R script, which I haven't included because it's not mine.

The France example simply pulls the daily data from an France's official data portal and performs a subtraction to get the day's total. 
The Cypriot example uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the figures from the Cypriot Ministry of Health website.
